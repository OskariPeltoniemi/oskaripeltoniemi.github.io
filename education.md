		<h3>AWS</h3>
		<p>I am interested in the AWS environment and the possibilities it brings. During my studies at JAMK I have been introduced to many of the tools offered by AWS and my goal is to increase my AWS knowledge.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>UI/UX</h3>
		<p>I am also interested in UI/UX design and they are partly related to my artistic hobbies. I consider them to be my strengths.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Coding languages</h3>
		<p>While studying at JAMK, I've mostly been using Javascript, Typescript, HTML and CSS. I also have some experience with Python and SQL.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
	<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Tools</h3>
		<p>Working on projects, I have become familiar with Figma. I also did my thesis on "Creating a Figma learning material for a usability course". I also have some knowledge of React and Angular, although I wouldn't consider them to be a strength yet.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>I am also fascinated by testing and have done end-to-end testing with Jasmine on several school projects.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Communication</h3>
		<p>Other than Finnish, which is my primary language, I'm also quite fluent in english. I must also mention that I think I am a good team player, because I listen, compromise and take into account the opinions of others, as well as present my own.</p>
