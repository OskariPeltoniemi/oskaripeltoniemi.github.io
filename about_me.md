					<h3>Who am I?</h3>
				</header>
				<ul>
					<li>Oskari Peltoniemi</li>
					<li>25 years old</li>
					<li>From Jyväskylä</li>
					<li>Graduated from University of applied sciences in Jyväskylä</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I decided to study the field because I have always been attracted to problem solving. I also want to be involved in creating something that has a technological impact on people's everyday lives, so this field creates plenty of opportunities for that.</p>
				<p>I also love spending time in nature (as you can see from my photo), as it relaxes and refreshes me and motivates me to do things that require inspiration.</p>

					<h3>Art</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Being artistic is a big part of my hobbies. I draw and paint both traditionally and digitally in many different mediums. I prefer traditional mediums since they let you work on something physical and mix mediums to your liking.</p>

					<h3>Games</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Video gaming has also been a standard way for me to relax or just have fun. I really like automation/factory building games or any game you can unleash your creativity in. I also prefer games that are a bit calmer and where you have to think and solve puzzles, rather than fast-paced action shooters.</p>

					<h3>Dungeons & Dragons</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I’m passionate about creativity and also storytelling so D&D tabletop roleplaying game has been quite a nice way to explore through both of these aspects. The most interesting things about D&D are the dialogue and role-playing with your own character, and the endless possibilities. That's when you get to unleash your own creativity. So far I have only been involved as a player, but it is likely that one day I will run my own campaign.</p>
