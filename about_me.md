					<h3>Art</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Being artistic is a big part of my hobbies. I draw and paint both traditionally and digitally in many different mediums. I prefer traditional mediums since they let you work on something physical and mix mediums to your liking.</p>

					<h3>Games</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Video gaming has also been a standard way for me to relax or just have fun. I really like automation/factory building games or any game you can unleash your creativity in. I also prefer games that are a bit calmer and where you have to think and solve puzzles, rather than fast-paced action shooters.</p>

					<h3>Dungeons & Dragons</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I’m passionate about creativity and also storytelling so D&D tabletop roleplaying game has been quite a nice way to explore through both of these aspects. So far I have only been involved as a player, but it is likely that one day I will run my own campaign.</p>
